Recurrent World Models Facilitate Policy Evolution. David Ha, Jürgen Schmidhuber (2018) In: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31. Ed. by S. Bengio et al.

In this paper we provide a successful reproduction of the results of Ha et al 2018, and additionally show that using a random recurrent neural network instead of a trained one provide competitive performance.
